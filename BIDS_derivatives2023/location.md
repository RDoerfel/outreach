## Getting there

From the train station: right outside the train station, take bus 5A towards Husum Torv. Get off at the stop called “Scandinavia” (3 stops away). The hotel is right across the street.

From the airport: take the metro towards Vanløse. Get off at the stop called “Islands Brygge” (6 stops away). From there, take bus 5A towards Husum Torv. Get off at the stop called “Scandinavia” (3 stops away). The hotel is right across the street.

## Getting around

Denmark does not use the Euro. The currency is the Danish Krone (DKK). You can exchange money at the airport, or at the hotel. You can also withdraw money from an ATM, but most transactions are electronic and you can pay with a credit card and your phone almost everywhere. 

Buying transportation tickets can be painful in Copenhagen. While you can buy a ticket at various locations, we highly recommend to buy tickets on your phone using the [DOT app](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/en/tickets/sales-outlets/dot-tickets-app/). Simply show your ticket on your phone when asked.
