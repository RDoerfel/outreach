# BIDS DERIVATIVES MEETING - 21-23 / 06 / 2023

Organized by the [OpenNeuroPET project](https://openneuropet.github.io/), the workshop physically brings together the international working group of the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](www.bids-standard.org) to further develop the BIDS specification for derivatives.

This event is sponsored by the [Novo Nordisk foundation](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/) & [The Lundbeck foundation](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en)

The meeting takes place at the Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel, Amager Boulevard 70, 2300 Copenhagen -- this is also where we have booked room and breakfast, see details about [the hotel, how to get there, and other travel info here](https://github.com/openneuropet/outreach/blob/main/BIDS_derivatives2023/location.md)

## Local organizers

Melanie Ganz: melanie.ganz [at] nru.dk  
Cyril Pernet: cyril.pernet [at] nru.dk  

## Attendees

Participants are be members of the BIDS steering group, BIDS maintainers, the lead of the BIDS extension proposals that concern derivatives and other members of the communauty. The full [list of partcipants can be found here](https://github.com/openneuropet/outreach/blob/main/BIDS_derivatives2023/attendees.md).

### Schedule

The workshop will consists of 2 ½ days (Wednesday afternoon - Friday) of collaborative working on aligning the different BIDS extension proposals for derivatives across all neuroimaging modalities (most prominently MRI, MEG, EEG and PET). Despite a schedule, if you have something that needs presented, an idea, whatever, we'll make the time for that. The plan is very much to interact and bounce ideas as much as possible.
