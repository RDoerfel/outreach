# BIDS DERIVATIVES MEETING - 21-23 / 06 / 2023

Organized by the [OpenNeuroPET project](https://openneuropet.github.io/), the workshop physically brings together the international working group of the the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](BIDS, www.bids-standard.org) to further develop the BIDS specification for derivatives.

This event is sponsored by [Novo Nordisk fonden](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/)

Participants are be members of the BIDS steering group (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/2022/11/07/BIDS-Steering-Group-Election-2022.html), BIDS maintainers, the lead of the BIDS extension proposals that concern derivatives (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/get_involved.html#extending-the-bids-specification) 

### Schedule

The workshop will consists of 2 Â½ days (Wednesday afternoon - Friday) of collaborative working on aligning the different BIDS extension proposals for derivatives across all neuroimaging modalities (most prominently MRI, MEG, EEG and PET).
