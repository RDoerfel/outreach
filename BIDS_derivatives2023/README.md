# BIDS DERIVATIVES MEETING - 21-23 / 06 / 2023

Organized by the [OpenNeuroPET project](https://openneuropet.github.io/), the workshop physically brings together the international working group of the the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](www.bids-standard.org) to further develop the BIDS specification for derivatives.

This event is sponsored by the [Novo Nordisk foundation](https://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/) & [The Lundbeck foundation](https://lundbeckfonden.com/en)

## Attendees

Participants are be members of the BIDS steering group, BIDS maintainers, the lead of the BIDS extension proposals that concern derivatives and other members of the communauty.

### Schedule

The workshop will consists of 2 ½ days (Wednesday afternoon - Friday) of collaborative working on aligning the different BIDS extension proposals for derivatives across all neuroimaging modalities (most prominently MRI, MEG, EEG and PET). Despite a schedule, if you have something that needs presented, an idea, whatever, we'll make the time for that. The plan is very much to interact and bounce ideas as much as possible.
