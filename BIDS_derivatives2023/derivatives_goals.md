# Goal

Obtain a consensus on what derivatives should be primarily for, offering a vision to drive BEPs.  
Get ideas of the main roadblocks to address during the meeting.

# Method

For all attendees the following, we asked the following questions several weeks before the meeting:  
1. What is your vision for derivatives? (a vision is the non technical expression of what you want it to do, e.g. I can see output X being reused across labs for Y or output X can be easily reused by ML experts)  
2. There are two views on derivatives: A. it should store the outcome of a pipeline + share code B. it should document every steps, and thus store every step. --> what is your view? --> to help developing BEP derivatives, would it be useful to have a framework/guidelines considering the focus of derivatives i.e. re-usage?
3. Given your involvement in BIDS and derivatives, what is/are the current roadblocks to advance your project?
  
Answer were collected by email and compiled and assembled into broad categories.
