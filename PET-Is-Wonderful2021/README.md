As of now we have already gotten allocated a 30 minute session for a presentation and then discussion amongst PET people.
I would propose to do the INCF talk again, but please come with ideas!
And then just have a discussion after

-> right now we don't need to sedn an abstract in, but we might want to??? Deadline is 29th August 2021 

Correspondence with PiW:

Dear Melanie,

Thanks for your email – all looks great to me! Apologies for my slow turnaround, but I was off on annual leave and I’m now going through my emails.

Yes, we can set-up a live poll during the talk. I will pass these questions along to our conference partner (GloCast), so they can start building the session. They will get in touch with you and Anthony closer to the event date to show you how the online platform works and have a “mock” test of the session.

Look forward to your talk and this session!

Meanwhile, we still have the abstract submission open (https://petiswonderful.org/pet-is-wonderful-2021/),  so feel free to share this across your networks, in case someone wants to submit a scientific abstract for presentation at the meeting.
 
Kind regards,

Adriana

Subject: Re: PET is Wonderful Abstract Admission for OpenNeuro PET

 
Dear Adriana,

thanks for the flexibility. I didn't communicate to Anthony that he doesn't need to submit a regular abstract, 
but rather a short description for you. Below you can see a short description. one of us (most likely me) will 
present a short overview 15 minutes over OpenNeuroPEt and PET BIDS and then we could like you suggested have a 
discussion.

Would it be possible to have people answer a poll during my talk with the questions:

Have you heard of BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)?

Have you heard of PET BIDS?

Have you previously worked with data you received from outside your lab?

Have you previously shared data with researchers beyond your lab?

Kind regards,

Melanie
